\title{greatientr: A Package for Calculating Invasion Risk}
\description{
This package provides tools for calculating invasion risk based on functional
diversity indices and CSR (Competitive-Stress tolerant-Ruderal) strategies.
The main functions include calculation of functional diversity metrics,
CSR proportions, and overall invasion risk scores.
}
\section{Main Functions}{

\itemize{
\item calculate_fd_indices(): Calculate Functional Diversity Indices
\item calculate_csr_props(): Calculate CSR Strategy Proportions
\item calculate_invasion_risk(): Calculate overall invasion risk score
}

Data Requirements and Preparation
}

\section{Data Format}{

The package requires three main data files in CSV format:
\itemize{
\item Species Traits (traits_matrix.csv) containing leaf measurements

@section traits_matrix.csv example:

\item Abundance Matrix (abundance_matrix.csv) with species counts per site
\item CSR Strategy Data (csr_data.csv) with strategy proportions
}
}

\section{Requirements}{

\itemize{
\item All species names must match exactly across files
\item No missing values are allowed in trait measurements
\item Abundance values must be non-negative integers
\item Each site must have corresponding CSR strategy measurements
\item All numerical values should be normalized between 0 and 1
\item CSR proportions must sum to 1 for each site
}
}

\section{Data Preparation}{

\itemize{
\item Normalize continuous variables to 0-1 scale
\item Remove outliers and check data quality
\item Ensure consistent units across measurements
